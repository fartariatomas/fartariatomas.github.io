# {{ page.title }}
I'm living in Lisbon, Portugal with my wife, (1 month old) kid and dog.</p>
			<p>I'm working in Marionete, a big data, data science and devops consultancy
			company. They have several partnerships with major players and everybody here
			is super competitive and driven to improve. They are actually hiring so if
			you are interested in learning and working with the newest open-source tech,
			email me and I'll forward your CV.</p>
			<p>The technologies I am currently dealing with more are: <aScala, Apache
			Kafka and Apache Cassandra.</p>
			<p>My interests now range from taking care of my family, reading (
			science fiction (Cycle of Arawn) and technical books(Learning Cassandra).</p>
