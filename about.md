I'm living in Lisbon, Portugal with my wife, (1 month old) kid and dog.

I'm working in [Marionete]("https://marionete.co.uk/"), a big data, data science and devops consultancy company. They have several [partnerships]("https://marionete.co.uk/company/#partners") with major players and everybody here is super competitive and driven to improve. 
They are actually hiring so if you are interested in learning and working with the newest open-source tech, let me know.

What I am up to now:
